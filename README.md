# Fashion_Recommendation_Deep_Learning_Model_using_Image_Features 👗🤖

Welcome to the **Fashion Recommendation System**! This project uses deep learning to recommend fashion items based on visual similarity. 🛍️💖

## 🚀 Project Overview

This Fashion Recommendation System leverages a **VGG16** convolutional neural network model to extract features from images and find similar fashion items. Using cosine similarity, the system recommends top N similar fashion images based on the input image provided.

### 💡 How It Works
1. **Feature Extraction**: Each fashion image is processed to extract visual features using a pre-trained VGG16 model. 🖼️🔍
2. **Similarity Calculation**: The features of the input image are compared with all other images using cosine similarity. 🤔💭
3. **Recommendation**: Based on the similarity score, the system recommends the top N most similar images. 🌟👚👗
